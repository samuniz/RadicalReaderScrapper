# Radical Reads Scrapper

 Radical Reads scrape is a web scraper that displays the most recent articles from radical reads. Users can save artciles to their favorites list and leave comments on their saved articles. Comments can be individually deleted, and articles can be deleted in batches.

This project was created as an assignment from Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp.




Click the 'Scrape' link on the navigation bar to populate some articles! You can also delete the articles with the 'Clear' link.



Click the 'â™¥' button to add reviews to your favorites list. Your favorites can be viewed by clicking the 'Favorites' link on the navigation bar. Saved reviews can be unsaved by clicking the red 'trasH can' button.



Leave comments on a saved article by clicking the 'Comments' button. Type in your name and comment in the form that pops up. After clicking the 'Add Comment' button, your comment will display next time you click 'Comments' button. Comments can be deleted by clicking the red 'trash can' button next to the review you want to delete.
